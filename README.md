# Neural Dynamics of Learning and Memory

This project simulates a small neural network with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) to study learning and memory processes.

## Directory Structure
- `src/`: Source code for network model, simulation, analysis, and visualization.
- `data/output/`: Stores simulation results (spike times, weights).
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the network.
- `run_simulation.py`: Main script to run the simulation.

## Setup
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the simulation: `python run_simulation.py`

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Testing
Run tests with: `pytest tests/`
